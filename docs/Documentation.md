## Installing plugins
To install plugins to **autotheme.css**, you must use **@import**.
More information can be found [Here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/Plugins.md)
<br>Example:<br>
![Preview](https://i.alexflipnote.xyz/b8f707.png)

You can also install the theme by using the **INSTALL.bat** that is located in the root folder.
By using it, you agree to it installing all needed things listed below:
- Chocolately
- Python (latest)
  - beautifuldiscord

The installer will also make a new folder in your **Documents** called **DiscordTheme**.
Inside there you will find a new file called **autotheme.css**
You can customize the file however you want, save it and see the changes happen instantly to your Discord client.

## Making a plugin
By making a plugin to **AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme**, you agree that your file will be used and *owned* by **Discord_Theme**, you can by any will, add credits to your work. All plugins have to be in **.scss** format, meaning you're not allowed to use anything else, that includes just normal **.css**

Remember that everything you make **must** be documented in [Plugins.md](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/Plugins.md) to provide easier access for users who wish to use either our or your creation.

## Colour usage
In our theme, we have a global variable called :root, it can be found similar to this
```css
:root {
  /*--<var>: <value>*/
  --accent: mediumpurple;
  --dark-primary: #212121;
  --dark-secondary: #303030;
}
```
**Usage:**
```css
#user-profile-modal .header {
  background-color: var(--dark-primary);
  background-image: none;
}
```
Having global variables makes colours easier to change, rather than changing one by one.
This might not be supportive when it comes to browsers **( Tested & works on: Chrome, Firefox )**

## Freeze time to grab CSS
There's a command you can use in console to freeze time and grab CSS from menus:
```js
setTimeout(function(){debugger;}, 5000);
```
With this, you don't have to worry about finding those things that disappears if you just click away for a second.
